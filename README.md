# PyBer_Analysis

## Project Overview
The CEO of PyBer, a ride-sharing app, has asked me to analyze ride-sharing data and create visualizations. I have been asked to create a summary DataFrame of ride-sharing data by city type. Using Pandas and Matplotlib, I created a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for rural, suburban, and urban city types.

## Resources
- Data Source: city_data.csv, ride_data.csv

## Results
###	Ride-sharing DataFrame:
  -	Urban cities had the highest total amount of rides. Rural cities had the lowest total amount of rides.
  -	Urban cities had the highest total amount of drivers. Rural cities had the lowest total amount of drivers.
  -	Urban cities had the highest total fares. Rural cities had the lowest total fares. 
  -	Rural cities had the highest average fare per ride. Urban cities had the lowest average fare per ride.
  -	 Rural cities had the highest average fare per driver. Urban cities had the lowest average fare per driver.
  -	Suburban cities remained in the middle of Rural and Urban cities for all categories.

###	Total Fare by City Type:
  -	The multiple-line graph shows that rural cities have a lower total fare compared to suburban or urban cities. In the beginning and mid-sections of January, and the beginning and end of February, rural cities have higher total fares. The peak time period would be in April. 
  -	Suburban cities have the highest total fares towards the end of February. Lowest total fares are in mid-April and beginning of January. 
  -	Urban total fares are highest at the end of February to beginning of March. Lowest total fares occur at the beginning of January and end of April.
  -	All city types have the highest total fares towards the end of February.
